      <h2>Recent Space Discoveries</h2>
      <div class="space-fact">
        <h3>Discovery 1: Water on Mars</h3>
        <p>
          In recent years, scientists have discovered evidence of liquid water
          on Mars, suggesting the possibility of past or even present life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-fact">

          Proxima Centauri b is an exoplanet orbiting the closest star to our
          solar system, Proxima Centauri. It is located in the habitable zone,
          making it a potential candidate for extraterrestrial life.
        </p>

          Gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime caused by violent events
          like merging black holes, were directly detected for the first time,
          confirming a prediction of Albert Einstein's theory of general
          relativity.
